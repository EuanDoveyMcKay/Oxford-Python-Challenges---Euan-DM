Challenge 1 Learning review:

Before doing this, I had absolutely no idea how to use matplotlib, and very little about using numpy; now I feel that I know the basics, which will help in the next challenges. I could not manage to do the "extensions" due to their difficult nature, although I did attempt them: I tried to use the scatter function for the butterfly curve at the same time as a colour map, which did successfully make a bunch of rainbow markers in the correct shape, but I fell short when trying to make a rainbow line connecting them; and, looking at the solution, I don't think I would have come across the correct way to do it either, so I'm glad I knew where to quit.

Doing this first challenge has also allowed some useful insight into how Oxford university likes to issue tasks and problems to their students; the details of what needs to be done are listed, and the resources which will be needed are given, but there is no form of hand-hold-like method at all, with all the figuring out of how to use the libraries and researching the mathematical equations needing to be done by me. I was skeptical at first of how much it wanted me to figure everything out for myself, but then quickly realised the benefits of presenting the challenge like this - it means that the learner has to truly understand and rationalise the concepts on their own terms, which reinforces the knowlege to a far greater magnitude that if it were done in the conventional way of telling the learner what to do.
